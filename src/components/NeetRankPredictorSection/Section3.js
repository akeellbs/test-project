              <p>
                Candidates should be aware that the NEET UG rank predictor's
                predictions are only suggestive and should not be regarded as
                final rankings. Furthermore, the predictor's output is dependent
                on the information entered by the candidates. The NEET Rank
                predictor is based on past years' rankings and an algorithm
                developed by NEET specialists. It shall only be used to estimate
                the NEET rank and chances of getting into the desired NEET
                participating colleges.
