			<h4>NEET Qualifying Marks</h4>
			<p>NEET qualifying marks are the minimum scores required to be selected for the NEET counseling merit list. Contrary to common misconception, NEET qualifying marks are not half of the NEET score (i.e., half of 720=360). The NEET UG qualifying marks represent the 50th percentile, meaning you need to outperform 50% of total aspirants who appeared for the NEET entrance exam to qualify for NEET counseling.
				The NEET qualifying mark varies annually, typically ranging from 150 to 200. However, it's crucial to note that simply scoring within the 150-200 range in the NEET UG exam does not guarantee admission into medical colleges in India. Utilizing tools like Motion Education's NEET College Predictor can provide further clarity and guidance regarding potential college options based on your performance.
